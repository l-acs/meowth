# meowth

## About

Make a DIY Rocketchat bot!

The primary reasons meowth was created (as opposed to just using the
Rocketchat REST API by itself) were my desire for
  * ease of use
  * access to streamlined but powerful bulk operations
  * flexibility in said bulk operations


Currently, its main use case is to send messages to many or all the
users on a server. My goal in doing this was having it be able to
customize the message to a degree that recipients doubt it was even
automated, and respond as if I had just sent it myself.

## Templating

To accomplish this, I made use of weavejester's
[https://github.com/weavejester/comb](comb)) to read in a templated,
user-defined blurb that would change according to particular
attributes about a user.

This could simply being using a first name:

> Hi `<%=first-name%>`! We're going through the list of users, and it looks like we haven't messaged before.

(Meowth is written in Clojure, so its configuration file is in
Clojure's Extensible Data Notation, EDN. The configuration is
relatively straightforward.) A handful of fields are already available
this way:



```
   :first-name ;; a user's first name, either taken from the name they set for themselves or by parsing their email address.
   :email
   :rooms ;; the list of channels a user is in
   :username
   :bio ;; a user's status
   :self-set-name ;; the name a user sets for themselves on Rocketchat
   :timezone
   :connection ;; is the user online?
   :channel-groups ;; which of the predefined groupings of channels in the configuration file is the user a part of?
   :messaged? ;; has this account message this user before?
   :__all ;; all 'raw' details about a user, in case this partial interface to that information is insufficient

```

Anything missing could be gleaned from `:__all` in a pinch.


## Channel groups
Note, in particular, `:channel-groups`. You can define a list of
channels in the configuration by which to sort users. For example, in
one of my use cases (a server for students in the linguistics
department), there were two channel groups:


```
 :channel-groups {
          :language-channels [
                              "wolof"
                              "xhosa"
                              "yiddish"
							  ...
                              "urdu"
                              "welsh"
							  ]
          :course-channels [
                            "comp-ling-445"
                            "ling-201"
                            "ling-210"
                            "ling-360"
							...
							]
						}
```

The 'bot' would then send different sentences according to which
category the user was in (among being in one of both types of the
channels, in just the language channel group, in just the course
channel group, or in neither). But meowth's real power comes from more
advanced operations. More sophisticated uses can leverage interspersed
Clojure logic thanks to `comb`.


## Leveraging Clojure
Here is a simplified version of the aforementioned example's `:blurb`:

> We're looking for feedback about how you like the site. Please share your thoughts!
>
>
> ```<%=
> (let [incourse? (not (empty? (:course-channels channel-groups)))
>       inlang? (not (empty? (:language-channels channel-groups)))]
>   (case [incourse? inlang?]```

>
> `[true true]` \"Okay, so it looks `test` like you've gotten a chance to join some course and language channels! That's awesome. \"
>
> `[true false]` \"Okay, so it looks like you've gotten a chance to join course channels, which is great! But by the way, we also have a _lot_ of language channels. They're in the directory (the little globe button in the menu), like #french, #cree, #ipa, etc!\"
>
> `[false true]` \"Okay, so it looks like you've gotten a chance to join some language courses, awesome.\n\n Oh but oh no, you're not in any course groupchats yet- be sure to join them! They're named #ling-201, #phil-210, #comp-ling-445, etc- click the directory (globe button in the menu) to see the full list. This was the main reason we made the site\n\nTLDR, our goal is to provide students a unified, centralized place for all things linguistics, from tutoring to class groups, to event information.\"
>
> `[false false]` \"Oh no, okay, so it looks like you're not in any course groupchats yet- be sure to join them! If you don't already know, they're like the main reason we made the site! There's a chat for every course in the department ( #ling-201, etc) and others in the program ( #phil-210, #comp-ling-445, etc).\n\nYou can scroll through them and join yours in the directory (click the globe button in the menu to see the full list). Basically our goal is to provide ling students a unified, centralized place for all things linguistics, from tutoring to class groups, to event information.\n\nTo that end, we also have a bunch of language exchange channels to nerd out, practice, ask questions, whatever. For example, there's #french, #mandarin, #ipa ... again, you can see all that in the directory! Even if you're totally new to linguistics, talking with these folks is a lot of fun and it's an awesome way to make friends in your classes or just generally meet people who share your interests :)\"`)) %>`


As you can see, it allows the person running meowth the be quite
elaborate (if they so choose) in how personalized a message might
get.
Or, for another example, this message ended with:

> `<%= (if (not selfsetname) `\"\n\n(Also, I'm pretty sure other people can't see your email/username, so it might be a good idea to set your name in settings so people can recognize you!)\" \"\"`) %>`


This flexibility is possible with such things as the Clojure interop,
but it's possible for someone who might not have technical experience
to have some degree of (perhaps robotic) personalization like the
first example

> Hi `<%=first-name%>`!

or similar.



## Basic configuration
Currently, this program reads a configuration file in order to
determine who to message when it runs, and what to say to each of
them. Hopefully in the future there will be a simpler and 'easier' way
for users to interface with it.


It is important to include basic information about the server and the account you'll use:

```
 :url "https://your.rocketchat.url"
 :token "your-43-character-token"
 :id "your-17-character-token"
```

There are also a couple of configurations:

  * If `:send-paragraphs-as-separate-messages` is true, the blurb with be split on double newlines (`\n\n`) into separate Rocketchat messages.
  * `:wpm` defines the rate, in words per minute, at which the bot should 'type' messages (to seem more human). If set to 0 or left `nil`, there will be no delay between separate messages.


As mentioned in earlier sections, you must also define a `:blurb` and, optionally, `:channel-groups`.
